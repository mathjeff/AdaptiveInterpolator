The project files, for building the code using Visual Studio, are located in Projects
  The projects under Projects/Phone currently work.
  The projects under Projects/WPF haven't been tested recently and probably aren't quite right, but nearly right
To use this code, invoke 'AddDatapoint' and 'Interpolate' within AdapativeLinearInterpolator
